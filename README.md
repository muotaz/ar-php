## _Introduction_

### Arabic Language
Internet use has grown quickly worldwide, especially in non-English speaking regions. Between 2000 and 2022, Arabic was the fastest-growing language online, increasing by 9,350%. It has around 240 million active users, making up 5.2% of internet users globally. This growth has created a demand for better Arabic web development tools, but most existing resources are geared toward English-speaking users.

[[Arabic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic), [Internet world stats](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.NET.USER.ZS?end=2022&locations=1A&start=1990&view=chart)]

### PHP
PHP is a widely used general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML. PHP runs more than 75% of all the top 10 million worldwide websites; a few very good examples are Facebook and Wikipedia.

### LGPL
The key difference between the GPL and LGPL is that the LGPL allows a library to be linked to, or used by, a program that is not licensed under the (L)GPL. This means the program can be either free or proprietary software. If the program is not a derivative work of the library, it can be distributed under any license or terms chosen by its creator.

## _Installation_

### Installation with Composer

To install this package using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
composer require khaled.alshamaa/ar-php
```

Ensure that the Composer autoloader is included in your project. If your project already uses Composer's autoloading mechanism -like frameworks such as Laravel- you can skip this step. Otherwise, add the following line early in your project's initialization code:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

### Manual Download and Installation
Download the [latest Ar-PHP release](https://github.com/khaled-alshamaa/ar-php/releases/latest), extract it into your project directory, and include the library by adding:

```php
require_once 'ar-php/src/Arabic.php';
```

Ensure the path matches the location of the Arabic.php file relative to your script.

The `bz2` extension has to be enabled for the spell checking feature of Al-Mosahih to be setup properly.

## _Contributing_
We welcome contributions from the community! Whether it is reporting bugs, suggesting new features, or submitting pull requests, your help is valuable. Before contributing, please review our project logistics and [TODO list](https://github.com/khaled-alshamaa/ar-php/blob/master/TODO.md) for current tasks and priorities. If you are migrating from an older version, check out our [UPGRADE guide](https://github.com/khaled-alshamaa/ar-php/blob/master/UPGRADE.md) to ensure a smooth transition. No matter what your skills and interests are, there is a place where you can participate in improving the Ar-PHP project:

* __Programming:__ Here are some ideas for contribution: Review the To-Dos, add a feature, contribute to a core module, create an extension, and fix a bug.
* __Quality Assurance:__ Quality Assurance (QA) is one of the most important but understated elements of any software community project. It is also something most people can do. If you want to help fix Ar-PHP bugs and you are not a programmer, you can still help by joining the QA team.
* __Writing:__ One of the best ways to contribute to Ar-PHP is to write tutorials, guides, HOWTOs, and FAQs. Here are some ideas for contributions: User FAQs, HOW-Tos and Tutorials, a User Guide, a Development Primer, Blog Posts, and an Article for a Magazine.
* __Marketing:__ You can always help promote the use of Ar-PHP. Here are two ways you can help: Join the marketing events and distribute Ar-PHP and its brochures.
* __Graphics and Art:__ Have any art skills? Then you can help us create icons, logos, banners, labels, wallpapers, screen savers, and more! These will be seen every day and used throughout the project and its products.
* __Helping Users:__ There are two ways you can help other users: Users mailing list, and forums.
* __Celebrate with us!__ Your task is to take a picture of yourself supporting the PHP and Arabic language project. You can go to a famous landmark, your favorite place nearby, or anywhere you think will make for a great photo. We've created some posters for you to use in your pictures. Print out one of these designs or design your own. We want to see you and your location prominently displayed in the picture, so don't let one of them dominate the photo. And we should clearly see your Ar-PHP poster too. Once you have your photos ready to submit, email them to us. Please send your photos in .jpg or .png formats and at least 1200 x 800 pixels in size.
